First project for TOP.



This project should be a test of basic HTML syntax, as well as git and
GitHub management.

Since this is my first website, there are many things that could be 
improved (using CSS and JavaScript/Ruby), so I will definitely come 
back to improve the project in the future.

Disclaimer: English is not my native language, so I will also improve 
my writing skills.
