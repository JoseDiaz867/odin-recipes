        <h4>A crispy, golden pastry filled with warm, melted cheese, offering a simple yet irresistible savory bite.</h4>

        <p>
            A warm, savory pastry filled with gooey, melted cheese encased in a golden, flaky or slightly crispy dough. 
            Popular in many Latin American countries, especially Chile and Argentina, it's often deep-fried or baked to 
            perfection. The rich, creamy filling contrasts beautifully with the crisp exterior, making it a comforting and 
            satisfying snack or appetizer with every bite.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 kilo all-purpose flour (without baking powder)</li>
            <li>70 grams of pork lard</li>
            <li>150 ml of liquid milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 kilo Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, place the sifted flour along with 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>Add the melted lard in the center and begin to add the warm milk, combine the ingredients to form the dough.</li>
            <li>Knead it for 5 minutes to develop the gluten (the dough’s elasticity). After that time, cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the resting time is complete, roll out the dough, forming discs about 2 millimeters thick.</li>
            <li>Grate the cheese and fill the dough discs with the mixture. Moisten the edges and fold the dough over. Seal the edges by pressing them with 
                the tip of a fork. Fry the empanadas in hot oil at 170°C (340°F) for about 3 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove them from the oil, place them on paper towels to drain, and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
