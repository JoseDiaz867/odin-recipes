        <h1>Lemon Pie</h1>

        <img src="./img/lemon-pie.jpg" alt="Lemon pie photo" width="500px">

        <h4>A zesty-sweet dessert with a crisp crust, tangy lemon curd, and a fluffy, golden-browned meringue topping.</h4>

        <p> 
            Classic dessert featuring a crisp, buttery crust filled with smooth, tangy lemon curd and topped with a light, fluffy meringue. 
            The lemon filling is vibrant and zesty, made with fresh lemon juice and zest, offering a perfect balance of sweet and tart. The 
            meringue, whipped to glossy peaks and lightly toasted in the oven, adds a soft, airy sweetness that contrasts beautifully with 
            the bright citrus base. Each bite combines creamy, crisp, and cloud-like textures in a refreshing and indulgent treat.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>Pie crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (300 g)</li>
            <li>1 cup icing sugar (200 g)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup butter (100 g)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lemon Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk (397 g)</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice (200 g)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meringue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar (200 g)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the flour with the powdered sugar, add the butter, and rub with your fingers until the mixture resembles sandy crumbs.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and 1 of the yolk (only the egg white are for the meringue), work the mixture with your hands until you get a compact dough.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough until it's about 0.5 cm thick and line a previously buttered and floured tart pan (approximately 26 to 28 cm in diameter).</li>
            <li>Prick the dough with a fork and bake in a preheated oven at medium-high temperature (180°C / 356°F) for 10 to 12 minutes until lightly golden. 
                Then remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the condensed milk, the lemon juice and the 2 remained yolk, stir until smooth. Pour this mixture over the pre-baked crust and return 
                to the oven for about 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the egg whites with the sugar and place over a gentle double boiler, stirring occasionally until the sugar crystals are completely
                 dissolved.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from the heat and beat vigorously for 8 to 10 minutes until the mixture triples in volume and becomes firm and glossy. Cover your pie 
                with the meringue and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
